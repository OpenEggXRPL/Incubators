## Introduction

OpenEgg was founded in October 2022 with an aim to decentralise and utilise $OVO within a fun, interactive and educational ecosystem built on the XRP Ledger. OpenEgg has transitioned into a non-profit
project where NFT income will be utilised to incentivise XRP Ledger use, NFT functions and increase XRP Ledger awareness and education. OpenEgg has so far realised OVOcrush, OVOdraw, lottOVO, and is currently working on a XRP Ledger metaverse space called the "Incubation Center". We have built up a wealth of
experience with our "Incubation OVOnaut Schemes"
, which has brought considerable USD value onto the XRP Ledger. This influx of USD value will have a ripple down effect which will greatly benefit all
XRPL projects in the long term due to the added value within the XRPL ecosystem.
We are now in a position to begin our works in realising one of our problem solve solutions. We have set out to bring our concept of the traditional balancer pools crossed with index funds and mixed with
our unique AI data inputs and all on the XRPL, with the additional NFT functionality. We have named this mix as our "Incubators". This is how we can maximise the value and use case that we will bring to the XRPL.
The Incubators will be available to anyone, and in turn this will have a snowball effect of increasing the XRP Ledger awareness and onboarding users to not only utilising the Incubators but to the entire XRP Ledger ecosystem as a whole, and the projects that are
currently developing on the network.
We would like to make this a staple target in all that we do, by bringing users to the ledger, adding value and use case to XRP and increasing the liquidity flowing within the entire XRPL ecosystem.
We aim to create a boutique systematic Incubator program that grabs exposures to a variety of sectors and is not limited by particular blockchains, all brought to the XRP Ledger
"All tides rise together"

## Incubators

Incubators are positioning to be a leading XRPL development with a range of simple and effective solutions to bring liquidity, value and education to the XRPL. We feel a suite of well selected, community governed and externally secured Incubators will enable crypto enthusiasts at all levels to be able to participate within the crypto space and defi space on the XRP Ledger with minimum
effort and simple processes. While utilising the Incubators you will also have free access to the our sections within educational spaces based on the XRPL. We have a vast netork of contacts on the XRP Ledger and as we always say "All tides rise together". We know we cant do everything and we know our passion is looking at numbers within crypto, so carefully selecting partners to help bring our mission to reality will be crucial. In retun a small % weighting will be placed for XRPL partnerting projects.
"Indexes have, for mostly performed better than singular picks, managed funds and the over the course of long term investment will outperform even the "hail-mary" throws into meme coins."
"Blockchain Indexes will be the big thing going forward in the years to come and Balancer pools have always been the go to pace for liquidity providers to receive a passive income." The AI integrated Indexes will come with added investor security that comes from cryptographically secured smart contracts, third party locks, and a well established team, we feel we have the ideal solution to bring a vast wealth of transactional value though our products and onto the XRPL that will give investors the chance to have positions throughout all of web 3 & all powered by the XRPL

## Incubator Solution

### Problems

- Complicated crypto onboarding routes
- Low investor education strategies
- Complicated mix of chains, networks and a myriad of projects
- Low liquidity on the XRPL
- Lack of DeFi on the XRPL
- Hard to gain exposure across web3

### Solves

- Simple, effective route to crypto exposure
- Incubators - Mix of balancer pools, indexes and LPs
- Education and Awareness
- DeFi Solution
- Increased liquidity
- Progressive advice
- Community driven
- XRP Ledger and XLS20 NFT utility

### Reason

A range of Incubators that bring the best aspects of Balancer pools, Traditional Indexes and Liquidity Pools onto the XRP Ledger and integrates utilised NFTs. Combining AI to run 24/7 with pre determined rebalancing periods and pre set in/out routes to bring maximum efficiency to the Incubator process.

Examples: Big 6, First Timers, Hail Mary, OVOpicks, Community Driven, DeFi

## Incubator Power

Each Incubator will have an initial hard cap and once that level has
been reached a new Incubator will be created. This is to make a simple
and effecient process to enbable NFTs to take the place of traditional
LP tokens. Input/Output will be in any crypto but the initial purchase
will be tied to a USD equivalent level that we call an OVOcard.

## OVOcard NFT

We have decided to shy away from the traditional LP Token system for a more tangible, intrinsically rewarding and XRP Ledger focussed system. OVOcard NFT will be proof of ownership within the Incubator ecosystem.
NFTs are now available on the XRP Ledger and we felt that the NFT route for LP providing into the Incubators would bring a new wave of utilised roles for NFTs on the XRP Ledger. Each OVOcard will have staking and reward availabilities whihc will be sustainably funded from our XRP/XRPL Incubator, this Incubator will be funded from external fees and income.
There will be 3 Incubator Tiers available to choose from and these will have a variety of benefits and % discounts to encourage participation. These can be based on token holdings, pre allocation, fiat value levels and completing levels in our Educational and awareness spaces

### USD → Incubator → OVOcard → USD

## Process

OVOcard NFT will be you proof of ownership to the Incubator that you have allocated funds to. You will be able to redeem at pre agreed dates or receive a passive income from the Incubators effecient re
balancing, and depending on the Incubator you choose.
The details will be confirmed nearer launch, once we reach Beta testing to work out the most effective strategy and route works best.
Incubators will have a variety of tokens, up to 6, and these will be labelled the "Incubators Carton". The weightings will be strategically assigned to maximise the Incubators potential.

## XRPL Vision

Maximising on the hook amendment, native XRPL NFTs and the smart contract sidechains that are currently being developed by leading developers. We will position ourselves to maximise the best that the XRP Ledger has to offer and combine that with our crypto passion and knowledge to bring the Incubators to life and create a utilised demand for a DeFi product on the XRP Ledger.
XRP will be in the majority of the Incubators and a small % of each Incubator will be dedicated to the XRPL projects that help build out the ecosystem.
We feel the addition of XRP and XRPL project into the Incubators will greatly help add liquidity to the XRP Ledger ecosystem and also help gain traction for thE projects that build upon it. We feel a healthy set of projects on the XRP Ledger only adds to utilised role that XRP has to offer the new financial system and we can wait to be at the forefront of some very exciting and innovative developments going forward.
